# Question 18

There seems to be an issue with the kubelet not running on `kind-worker`. Fix it and confirm that cluster has node `kind-worker` available in Ready state afterwards. You should be able to schedule a *Pod* on `kind-worker` afterwards.

Write the reason of the issue into `/tmp/opt/course/18/reason.txt`.
