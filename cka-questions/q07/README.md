# Question 7

- *Task weight: 1%*

Use context: `kubectl config use-context k8s-c1-H`

The metrics-server has been installed in the cluster. Your colleague would like to know the kubectl commands to:

1. show Nodes resource usage
2. show Pods and their containers resource usage

Please write the commands into `/opt/course/7/node.sh` and `/opt/course/7/pod.sh`.
